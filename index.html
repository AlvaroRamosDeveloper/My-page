    <p>I am Alvaro Ramos Herrera, an ambicious guy who wanted to learn a new profession. I have always worked outside the world of software but there was something that called me to try it, the curiosity to know how things work that characterizes me. <br>I was born in Barcelona (Spain) in
      1987 but my residence is in Tungelsta (Sweden) since the end of 2014. </p>

    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <div class="skill-row">
      <h3>Imagination</h3>

      <p>I have the ability to solve problems by imagining new options to develop tasks and thus overcome difficulties by making them simpler. I like to work in the most efficient and simple way possible to obtain greater performance at work and
        minimize the effort of it.</p>

      <h3>Positivity & happiness</h3>

<p>My philosophy is very simple: Don't do what you wouldn't want done to you. <br>My relationship with life is full of love. We are in symbiosis, that means that she gave me the opportunity to exist, so I am grateful for that. Life has taught me that she can disappear in less than a second, so I have to be happy and try to solve the problems as fast as possible to remain happy.<br> The day we part, she will catch me with a smile on my face. &#128522; </p>
